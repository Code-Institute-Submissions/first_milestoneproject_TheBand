The band is a 1960’s rock band (The Monkees) and have around 50 years experience of performing live at numerous events around the world. 
You have been given the following requirements after interviews with the client’s representatives:
Their primary target audiences are their fans and potential fans who wish to use the site to see and hear clips from their back catalog, 
and any new material as it becomes available.

The band has provided you, the developer, with the following assets that they would like to showcase on their website:
